# Titanic Machine Learning
This project marks my first venture into Kaggle. The machine learning project aimed at predicting Titanic passenger survival, achieving an accuracy of 78% using nine classification algorithms.

The primary goals were to deepen my understanding of machine learning classification techniques and refine my data analysis skills. For those hesitating to dive into predictive modeling, feature engineering, and external Kaggle projects, I highly recommend starting—it’s a rewarding experience and a worthwhile investment of time.

I began by exploring the dataset through exploratory data analysis, gaining a solid understanding of the data structure. This involved addressing missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions, along with visualizing the data to identify patterns. I streamlined the dataset by converting numerical variables into categorical ones, tackling feature correlations, and conducting external research about the Titanic to uncover contextual insights. This process included feature engineering, creating, transforming, and selecting the most impactful features influencing survival rates.

After preparing the data, I implemented multiple predictive algorithms, documenting each step of the modeling process in detail. Random Forest with unlimited depth emerged as the top-performing model. Throughout the project, I recorded key takeaways, particularly in model building and feature engineering, with the hope that my insights will benefit others exploring these areas.

While there were challenges along the way, completing this project was both rewarding and fulfilling. I owe gratitude to shared notebooks and solutions from the Kaggle community, which helped resolve some obstacles. This experience has motivated me to continue exploring new data science projects to further hone my skills!.
