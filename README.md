# Titanic Machine Learning
This project marks my first venture into Kaggle. The machine learning project aimed at predicting Titanic passenger survival, achieving an accuracy of 78% using nine classification algorithms as list below.
1) Gaussian Naive Bayes
2) Logistic Regression
3) Perceptron
4) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
5) Decision Tree
6) Random Forest
7) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
8) Gradient Boosting Classifier
9) Support Vector Machines

The main goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of machine learning classification techniques and sharpen my data analysis skills. This project is part of Kaggle's tutorials, making it a great starting point for exploring machine learning workflows and uncovering hidden insights in a structured way. Even though it’s not a unique project but if you’re looking to get started with hands-on machine learning with clear guidance, this is a solid choice.

I began by exploring the dataset through exploratory data analysis, gaining a solid understanding of the data structure. This involved addressing missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions, along with visualizing the data to identify patterns. I streamlined the dataset by converting numerical variables into categorical ones, tackling feature correlations, and conducting external research about the Titanic to uncover contextual insights. This process included feature engineering, creating, transforming, and selecting the most impactful features influencing survival rates.

After preparing the data, I implemented multiple predictive algorithms, documenting each step of the modeling process in detail. Random Forest with unlimited depth emerged as the top-performing model. Throughout the project, I recorded key takeaways, particularly in model building and feature engineering, with the hope that my insights will benefit others exploring these areas.

Completing this project was both rewarding and fulfilling for me. This project has motivated me to continue exploring new data science projects to further hone my skills!.
