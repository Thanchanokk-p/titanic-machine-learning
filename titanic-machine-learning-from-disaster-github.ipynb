    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my very first project on Kaggle, My main goal is to work on external projects to improve my skills in data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, I’m really focused on understanding predictive models not just the results, but how machine learning works step by step behind the scenes to get those predictions. I also want to level up my ability to make data-driven decisions, sharpen my data analysis skills, and improve my overall data literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area I’m exploring is feature engineering, how to get creative with designing new features to make models more accurate. It’s all about finding ways to better understand and work with data to get the best possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re thinking about doing this project, don’t hesitate. just go for it! It’s a great way to boost your knowledge in predictive modeling, classification, and data analysis. Trust me, it’ll be totally worth it! 🚀"

    "Even though this project is beginner-friendly on Kaggle, it still comes with its fair share of challenges. Getting a good accuracy score isn’t just about basic data literacy, you really need to **visualize in your mind what assumptions you’re making and how you want your final dataset to look and How to ask good questions about your dataset**. It’s about figuring out how to **organize the data to uncover insights** while keeping things **efficient enough for the predictive models** to handle. For instance, binning features can simplify the data and make modeling easier, but it also sacrifices detail and might hurt your accuracy score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is absolutely critical here. **We need to think about what might actually influence the target variable**. In this case, \"survived.\" Sometimes you’ll deep dive into a feature, thinking it’s important, only to realize it has no real impact at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External research could help broaden your perspectives**. The more you learn about the Titanic, its passengers, and the overall situation, the better you’ll understand the context behind the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trying out **nine predictive models** was my favorite part. I wanted to get there as fast as possible. Understanding how these models work behind the scenes gave me a clearer picture of their strengths and weaknesses, which I can now apply to future projects. Key lessons during this process are that **what you believe to be the best choice may not always turn out as expected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the most challenging (but also the most rewarding) part was visualizing and **deciding on the right feature engineering strategies**, and **diving into how predictive models work**. It was totally worth the time and effort! 😄\n",
    "\n",
    "Big thanks to Kaggle’s Titanic notebooks and community, they helped me get unstuck more than once!💡"

    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses)** has a moderate positive correlation with `Parch` (0.41), suggesting passengers traveling with siblings/spouses often also travel with parents/children. Similarly, families with children often include siblings, indicating a connection between family-related features.\n",
    "- As one of our prediction model includes **decision trees**, it will be struggle to model linear relationships of high correlation and bettter to explcitly combine*. \n",
    "- **Fare** shows weak correlations with all other variables, implying it might be influenced more by categorical factors like `Pclass` or `Embarked` as the same as **Age**  that it might interact with categorical features such as `Sex` or `Pclass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "- **SibSp and Parch** are moderately correlated (0.41), reflecting family-based relationships.\n",
    "- Both `Fare` and `Age` have weak correlations with other numeric features, but categorical interactions may provide additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combine **SibSp** and **Parch** into a new feature (`FamilySize`) to better capture family-related relationships due to highly correlation.\n",
    "2. Create a new feature like **`IsAlone`** for Solo Travellers and **`FarePerPerson`** by normalizing `Fare` based on group size.\n",
    "3. Analyze interaction effects by combining features such as `Pclass` and `Sex` to capture how they jointly affect outcomes.\n"

    "**Decision trees, as one of our prediction models, struggle to model linear relationships with highly correlated features because they evaluate features independently at each split and lack the ability to understand feature combinations (e.g., `Feature1 + Feature2`). For instance, if `Family_Size = SibSp + Parch`, the tree does not recognize the relationship between `SibSp` and `Parch` unless explicitly combined, as it has no concept of addition or multiplication. In contrast, linear models like linear regression inherently handle linear relationships because they are based on weighted sums of features, making the creation of combined features unnecessary for such models unless needed for interpretability or to improve feature scaling.*"

    "### Overall Conclusion\n",
    "These correlations align closely with historical accounts of the Titanic tragedy:\n",
    "- **Gender**: Women had significantly higher survival chances due to the \"women and children first\" protocol.\n",
    "- **Socioeconomic Status**: Wealthier passengers in 1st and 2nd class were prioritized, benefiting from better proximity to lifeboats.\n",
    "- **Age**: Older passengers in lower classes were at a significant disadvantage due to slower mobility and systemic barriers.\n",
    "- **Group Size**: While traveling in groups or families generally improved survival chances, **socioeconomic status** and **class proximity to lifeboats** played a significant role for smaller groups or solo travelers. Wealthy individuals, even when traveling alone, could offset the disadvantage with better access and prioritization, demonstrating how survival depended on a complex interplay of class, fare, and group size."

    "#### Positive Correlations with Survival\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. \"Women and children first\" protocol during the Titanic disaster:**\n",
    "   - Based on the correlation of `Sex_female (0.54)`, female passengers show the highest positive correlation with survival. This reflects the priority women were given during lifeboat boarding, aligning with historical accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Proximity to lifeboats and socioeconomic status influenced survival chances:**\n",
    "   - `Pclass_Sex_1_female (0.41)` indicates that female passengers in 1st class had a very high survival correlation. This advantage stems from their gender and proximity to lifeboats, combined with preferential treatment. The same trend is observed for **`Pclass_Sex_2_female (0.34)`** and **`Pclass_1 (0.28)`**, showing that women in 2nd class were prioritized over 3rd class passengers.\n",
    "   - Furthermore, the correlation of **`Fare (0.26)`** highlights that higher fares correlate positively with survival, as passengers paying higher fares were more likely in 1st or 2nd class, linking survival chances to socioeconomic status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Survival outcomes were shaped by both group size and socioeconomic status:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Groups and families had a survival advantage**:\n",
    "   - **`IsAlone_0 (0.21)`** suggests passengers traveling with families or groups often cooperated during evacuation, increasing their survival chances compared to solo travelers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smaller groups or solo travelers with higher fares were exceptions**:\n",
    "   - **`FarePerPerson (0.23)`** shows that wealthier solo travelers or those in smaller groups, often in 1st or 2nd class, had better access to lifeboats, offsetting the disadvantage of traveling alone.\n"

    "\n",
    "**1. Male passengers had the lowest survival chances:**\n",
    "   - **`Sex_male (-0.54)`** shows that males faced the strongest negative correlation with survival, reflecting the prioritization of women and children during rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Being a male passenger in 3rd class reduced survival chances significantly:**\n",
    "   - **`Pclass_Sex_3_male (-0.40)`** and **`Pclass_3 (-0.32)`** confirm that 3rd class males were the least likely to survive. They were physically farther from evacuation points and received the lowest priority due to both class and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Traveling alone correlated negatively with survival:**\n",
    "   - **`IsAlone_1 (-0.21)`** suggests that passengers traveling alone lacked support during evacuation, reducing their survival chances compared to those in groups or families.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Older passengers in lower classes had reduced survival chances:**\n",
    "   - **`Age*Class (-0.32)`** indicates the combined disadvantage of older age and lower class, which hindered access to lifeboats. Older passengers were less mobile, which further reduced their survival prospects."

    "### Explanation of Interaction Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "As insights drawn from interaction terms, such as `Pclass_Sex` and `Age*Class`, combine the effects of two features. These terms can be useful in capturing relationships that might not be apparent when analyzing features separately. However, in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Pclass_Sex`:** The relationship between `Pclass` and `Sex` is straightforward and already captured by the individual features, making this term redundant.\n",
    "- **`Age*Class`:** Similarly, this combines `Age` and `Pclass`, but their individual effects already explain survival well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Learned: \n",
    "Creating interaction terms is a valuable feature engineering technique that can reveal complex relationships between variables. However, whether to keep an interaction term depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The context of the problem**: If the interaction term reflects a unique and important relationship, it should be kept.\n",
    "2. **Model performance and interpretability**: If the interaction term significantly improves the model’s performance or provides valuable insights, it should be retained. Otherwise, it may introduce redundancy or unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, interaction terms like `Pclass_Sex` and `Age*Class` do not add significant value and can be removed. Always evaluate interaction terms based on context, model performance, and their ability to reveal meaningful relationships. "

    "The `Sex` feature does not need to remain as categorical values (`male`, `female`) since it is a binary feature. By converting it to numerical values (`male = 0, female = 1`), we simplify the data for modeling purposes. This approach is particularly useful for machine learning algorithms that work better with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, during the earlier stages of feature engineering, keeping `Pclass_Sex` as a combined feature like `3_male` instead of `3_0` improves readability and interpretability. This is especially true when exploring the data or presenting insights to stakeholders, as it is easier to understand `3_male` than `3_0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting `Sex` to numerical values is appropriate for final modeling. However, in feature engineering, retaining categorical formats like `3_male` can enhance clarity and ease of understanding when interpreting or visualizing the data. The choice depends on the stage of the data analysis and the context of the task.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Perceptron is a **linear classification algorithm** inspired by biological neurons. It is the simplest type of neural network and works by finding a hyperplane that separates data into two classes. The Perceptron is useful for binary classification problems but assumes that the data is **linearly separable**. The model is **simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Decision Boundary**: Works well when the data can be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).\n",
    "- **Threshold-Based Predictions**: Outputs binary predictions directly (e.g., 0 or 1) rather than probabilities.\n",
    "- **Simple and Fast**: Very efficient to train and interpret but less powerful than modern algorithms.\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Scaling continuous features is important to ensure faster convergence and better performance.\n",

    "- The Perceptron models the relationship between input features (e.g., \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\)) and the target variable (e.g., class labels 0 or 1).\n",
    "- It calculates a **weighted sum** of the input features and passes it through a threshold activation function:\n",
    "  - If the weighted sum is **greater than 0**, the output is predicted as **1 (positive class)**.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, it predicts the output as **0 (negative class)**.\n",
    "- During training, the Perceptron adjusts its weights iteratively using the **Perceptron Learning Rule**:\n",
    "  - For every misclassified example, the weights are updated.\n",
    "- The algorithm **repeats until all training examples are classified correctly** (if the data is linearly separable) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied to Titanic Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Titanic dataset includes features such as **Pclass**, **Sex**, **Age**, **Fare**, **Embarked**, etc.\n",
    "- The Perceptron can use these features to predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- Features like **Sex** (binary) and numerical features like **Age** and **Fare** work well with the Perceptron as it assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.\n",
    "- The model is particularly effective when the dataset is **linearly separable**, but its performance degrades for datasets that are not.\n"

    "### 5.4.4 **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Model\n",
    "**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** is a versatile optimization algorithm widely used in training machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and deep learning. **It updates model parameters iteratively to minimize the loss function**. Unlike traditional Gradient Descent, which processes the entire dataset at once, SGD **updates parameters for each individual data point**, enhancing **efficiency and scalability** for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions include:\n",
    "- **Incremental Learning:** Processes data incrementally, making it suitable for large datasets and reducing memory usage.\n",
    "- **Convex Loss Function:** Ensures effective convergence for convex functions, achieving global minima.\n",
    "- **Learning Rate Sensitivity:** The learning rate must balance convergence speed and stability to prevent divergence.\n",
    "- **Noise Tolerance:** The stochastic nature of updates introduces randomness, which aids in escaping local minima in non-convex functions.\n",
    "- **Regularization Support:** Incorporates techniques to mitigate overfitting, further improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its advantages, SGD can exhibit instability near convergence due to oscillations, requiring careful learning rate tuning. Its reliance on single-sample gradients introduces noise that may slow convergence, and hyperparameter selection remains critical for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Start with random or zero values for model parameters (weights, biases).\n",
    "2. **Iterative Updates:**\n",
    "   - For each training sample (or batch in Mini-Batch SGD):\n",
    "     - Calculate the gradient of the loss function relative to the parameters.\n",
    "     - Update parameters using the formula that using Old model parameters (weight, biases) deduct by the multiplication of learning rate (step size) and Gradient of the loss function*.\n",
    "3. **Repeat Until Convergence:**\n",
    "   - Iterate through all training samples over multiple itreation (epochs) until the loss stabilizes or predefined stopping criteria (e.g., maximum epochs, minimum loss) are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied to Titanic Dataset:\n",
    "- The **Titanic dataset** includes features such as **Pclass**, **Sex**, **Age**, **Fare**, and **Embarked**.\n",
    "- SGD can be used to train models predicting passenger survival (1) or non-survival (0).\n",
    "- Features like **Sex (binary)** and numerical attributes such as **Age** and **Fare** contribute to effective loss minimization during training.\n",
    "- Its iterative update mechanism enables efficient handling of large-scale datasets, especially when combined with feature scaling and preprocessing."

    "### 5.4.5 **Decision Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Model\n",
    "Decision Trees are a versatile machine learning model **used for both classification and regression tasks**. They work by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values to create a **tree-like structure**, where each node represents a decision rule, and leaf nodes represent outcomes (e.g., a class label or prediction). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear models, **Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships** and effectively **handle both categorical and numerical features**. Their interpretable structure makes them a popular choice for understanding the decision-making process of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions include:\n",
    "- **Non-Linear Splits**: Decision Trees do not assume a linear relationship between features and the target variable, making them suitable for complex datasets.  \n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Features are split based on their ability to reduce impurity (**measured using Gini Impurity or Entropy, with the goal of minimizing these criteria to values close to 0**) at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When using **Gini Impurity** as the criterion for evaluating the quality of splits in a tree-based model, it measures the **degree of impurity or misclassification** in the data. The goal is to achieve the **lowest impurity** or the **highest purity** in its nodes. Lower impurity indicates that the model can effectively separate the classes within the nodes, resulting in more homogeneous groups. Conversely, higher impurity indicates that the node contains a mix of classes, leading to poorly defined separations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When using **Entropy** as the criterion, it measures the **uncertainty or disorder** in the data. The goal is to minimize entropy to **0**, which represents **maximum certainty** and indicates that the information in the nodes is well-ordered and predominantly from one class. In contrast, entropy closer to **1** represents **maximum uncertainty**, meaning the data in the nodes is highly disordered and contains an equal mix of different classes, making separation difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Splitting**: The model iteratively splits data until a stopping condition is met (e.g., maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf).  \n",
    "- **Overfitting Risk**: Decision Trees **can overfit the training data if the tree is too deep**, requiring regularization techniques like **pruning or setting depth limits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their strengths, Decision Trees can suffer from instability when trained on small datasets or noisy data, and are sensitive to small changes in the dataset. They are often combined with ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests) to improve robustness and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with the entire dataset and all available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting Data**:\n",
    "   - For each feature, evaluate potential splits by measuring how well they reduce impurity (e.g., Gini Impurity or Entropy).\n",
    "   - Choose the best split that maximizes information gain and create two child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Splitting**:\n",
    "   - Repeat the splitting process for each child node, using only the data assigned to that node.\n",
    "   - Continue splitting until stopping criteria are met (e.g., maximum tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, or no further impurity reduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stopping Condition**:\n",
    "   - Once the stopping criteria are met, assign the majority class (classification) or mean value (regression) of the data in each leaf node as the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied to Titanic Dataset  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Features**:  \n",
    "  The Titanic dataset includes features such as **Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked**. Decision Trees can handle these features directly, as they process both categorical and numerical data without the need for one-hot encoding or normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Rules**:  \n",
    "  Splits are created based on questions such as \"Is the passenger male?\" or \"Is the passenger in 3rd Class?\" to group passengers with similar survival probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outcome Examples**:  \n",
    "  Leaf nodes predict survival probabilities or binary outcomes:\n",
    "  - **Female, 1st/2nd Class**: High survival probability (e.g., 90%).  \n",
    "  - **Male, 3rd Class**: Low survival probability (e.g., 10%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency and Scalability**:  \n",
    "  The recursive splitting mechanism allows efficient handling of datasets, particularly when combined with constraints like maximum depth to prevent overfitting."

    "### Description of the Model\n",
    "A **Random Forest Model** is a powerful machine learning algorithm that **combines multiple decision trees** to make predictions. Each tree makes an independent decision based on the data, and the final outcome is determined by the majority vote of all the trees. This ensemble approach increases accuracy, reduces overfitting, and makes the model more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest can be thought of as a group of decision-making experts (trees), each analyzing the passenger data (e.g., gender, ticket class, siblings/spouses aboard) from different perspectives. By combining the decisions of all trees, the model improves accuracy and avoids over-reliance on any one feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an **ensemble learning method**, which reduces the likelihood of overfitting and helps to handle noisy or complex data. The advantages of the Random Forest Model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: Combining predictions from multiple trees reduces errors compared to a single tree.\n",
    "2. **Diversity**: Randomly selecting subsets of data and features helps avoid overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Robustness**: The model performs well even with noisy or missing data, as no single tree dominates the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Before building the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (such as gender), and scaling numerical features if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Building a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decision tree** is a model that makes decisions by splitting data into smaller, more homogeneous groups. The tree identifies the best splits for each feature to maximize the difference between survivors and non-survivors in the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. First Split: Gender**\n",
    "The tree starts by evaluating the `Sex` feature:\n",
    "- If the passenger is **female**, the tree moves down one branch.\n",
    "- If the passenger is **male**, the tree moves down another branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important split because **gender** had a significant influence on survival, with women being prioritized during rescue operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Second Split: Siblings/Spouses (`SibSp`)**\n",
    "For female passengers, the tree then examines the number of siblings or spouses aboard (`SibSp`):\n",
    "- If **`SibSp <= 3`**, the tree moves to the next split.\n",
    "- If **`SibSp > 3`**, the tree predicts **“Did Not Survive”** (`Survived = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold **`SibSp <= 3`** was found to be a good separator for predicting survival based on family size, where smaller families had higher survival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Third Split: Parents/Children (`Parch`)**\n",
    "For female passengers with **`SibSp <= 3`**, the tree evaluates the `Parch` feature (number of parents or children aboard):\n",
    "- If **`Parch < 4`**, the tree predicts **“Survived”** (`Survived = 1`).\n",
    "- If **`Parch >= 4`**, the tree predicts **“Did Not Survive”** (`Survived = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`Parch < 4`** threshold suggests that passengers with smaller families had better survival chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does the Tree Choose These Thresholds?**\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm automatically selects the thresholds by:\n",
    "1. Testing different possible splits for each feature.\n",
    "2. Using criteria like **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy** to evaluate how well each split separates survivors from non-survivors.\n",
    "3. Choosing the split that results in the most homogeneous groups (with most passengers either surviving or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree in the Random Forest learns different rules based on its data subset, leading to unique trees with different splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This describes the decision process of one tree. A Random Forest consists of multiple such trees, each making its own decisions.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Voting Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Random Forest has built multiple decision trees, it aggregates their predictions to determine the final outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Voting Works:**\n",
    "1. Each tree makes an independent prediction for the new passenger.\n",
    "2. The Random Forest counts the predictions from all trees using **majority voting**.\n",
    "3. The final prediction is the **outcome with the most votes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Voting**\n",
    "For a new passenger (`Sex = female`, `Pclass = 3`, `SibSp = 1`, `Parch = 0`), the trees in the Random Forest might predict as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree #1**: Predicts **Survived** (`1`).\n",
    "- **Tree #2**: Predicts **Did Not Survive** (`0`).\n",
    "- **Tree #3**: Predicts **Survived** (`1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The votes are tallied:\n",
    "- **2 votes for “Survived”**.\n",
    "- **1 vote for “Did Not Survive”**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Prediction**: The passenger is predicted to have **survived**, as it received the majority vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Thus, the final prediction for each passenger is determined by the majority vote of all the trees in the Random Forest.*\n"

    "### Exploring `n_estimators` and `max_depth`\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing the Random Forest model, different accuracy scores are obtained by varying the hyperparameters **Number of trees in the forest (`n_estimators`)** and **Maximum depth of trees (`max_depth`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Effect of `n_estimators` (Number of Trees)**\n",
    "- Increasing the number of trees improves model accuracy, especially in the early stages, by helping the model better capture patterns in the data and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "- However, beyond a certain point (e.g., 100-200 trees), accuracy plateaus as additional trees no longer add significant new information.\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Reduces variance in predictions, resulting in more stable and reliable outputs.\n",
    "  - Helps generalize the model to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - Beyond the plateau, adding more trees increases computational cost without significant accuracy gains or it might decrease accuracy score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Effect of `max_depth` (Maximum Tree Depth)**\n",
    "The maximum depth controls the trade-off between **node purity** and **model complexity**:\n",
    "- **Higher Depth**:\n",
    "  - Captures more detailed patterns, especially with `max_depth=None`, achieving maximum node purity.\n",
    "  - However, **deeper trees risk overfitting by learning unnecessary noise**, reducing performance on new data and increasing computational demands.\n",
    "- **Lower Depth**:\n",
    "  - **Limits the tree's ability to split excessively**, but reducing complexity and overfitting.\n",
    "  - Promotes **better generalization**, as the model focuses on meaningful patterns rather than noise.\n",
    "  - **Risk**: Too shallow trees may underfit, failing to capture important details in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Observations**\n",
    "- **Overfitting Prevention**: Limiting `max_depth` reduces the model's focus on minor details, improving generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Underfitting Risk**: Too small `max_depth` may miss key data patterns, lowering model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimentation\n",
    "Various values of `max_depth` were tested, as shown in the code, to identify the optimal balance for achieving the highest test accuracy.\n"

    "### Observations on `n_estimators` and `max_depth`\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained, I experimented with manual trial and error. When using the same `max_depth=7` but increasing the **number of trees (`n_estimators`)**, the accuracy improves initially. However, this is not always consistent. For instance, increasing the number of trees with `max_depth=5` resulted in a decrease in accuracy, or in some cases, the accuracy remained the same for different depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Striking the Balance between these two values\n",
    "Finding the optimal balance between `n_estimators` and `max_depth` is crucial. Here’s a recommended approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Point**:\n",
    "   - Use **`n_estimators=100`** as a baseline (a commonly good starting value).\n",
    "   - Set **`max_depth` between 5-10** to explore moderate tree depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Techniques**:\n",
    "   - Apply **Grid Search** or **Randomized Search** to systematically test combinations of hyperparameters for your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Begin with reasonable ranges for hyperparameters and assess performance using **Cross-Validation** or **Learning Curve** analysis.\n",
    "   - Aim to identify the \"sweet spot\" where **accuracy balances model complexity** and **generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "While increasing the number of trees generally improves accuracy, the effect depends on the chosen `max_depth`. Balancing these parameters is critical to achieving the best possible performance without overfitting or underfitting.\n"

    "### 5.4.7 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful **non-parametric supervised machine learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. The model makes predictions based on the **similarity of a data point to its closest neighbors** in the feature space. KNN does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it versatile for many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some complex models, KNN relies on **distance metrics** to measure the similarity between points and determine the most likely class or value of an unknown point based on its neighbors. It is particularly **effective for small datasets with normalized features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Similarity Matters**: Data points that are closer in the feature space are more likely to belong to the same class or have similar target values.\n",
    "2. **Feature Normalization**: Features must be scaled (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Standardization) to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations.\n",
    "3. **Instance-based Learning**: KNN does not involve explicit training. Predictions are made at runtime by comparing the query point to the stored training examples.\n",
    "4. **Choosing 'K'**: The number of neighbors ('K') plays a critical role, A **larger value of K means the model considers a broader range (greater number of nearby neighbors or perspective)** by including more neighbors in its decision-making process. When you want to predict the class or value of a new data point, the model looks at the K 'neighbors' (the closest data points) in the nearby area (called the feature space) and uses information from those neighbors to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does the Choice of 'K' Affect the Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "| **K Value**       | **Description**                                                                                     | **Advantages**                                   | **Potential Issues**                              |\n",
    "|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Small K** (e.g., K=1 or K=3) | Focuses on the closest neighbors, using only a few nearby data points.                                      | - High accuracy in densely packed regions.      | - Overfitting: Sensitive to noise or outliers.   |\n",
    "| **Large K** (e.g., K=10 or K=20) | Considers a broader neighborhood, looking at many neighbors in the dataset.                              | - Reduces sensitivity to noise.                | - Underfitting: Misses fine-grained patterns.    |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Note:\n",
    "- Small values of 'K' can lead to **overfitting**, while large values can smooth out predictions, potentially missing important details in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, KNN is computationally intensive, especially for large datasets, as it requires calculating distances for all training points during predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Choose the number of neighbors (**K**) to consider for predictions.\n",
    "   - Prepare the dataset by normalizing feature values to ensure equal contribution to distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Calculation**:\n",
    "   - For a given query point, calculate the distance between the query and all training points in the dataset. Common distance metrics include:\n",
    "     - **Euclidean Distance**: Straight-line distance, Sensitive to large values, suitable for Low-dimensional space\n",
    "     - **Manhattan Distance**: Along axes/grid, Less sensitive, High-dimensional/sparse\n",
    "     - **Minkowski Distance**: Customizable, Generalized form of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neighbor Selection**:\n",
    "   - Identify the **K closest neighbors** to the query point based on the chosen distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prediction**:\n",
    "   - **For Classification**:\n",
    "     - Count the classes of the K neighbors.\n",
    "     - Assign the majority class as the predicted label.\n",
    "   - **For Regression**:\n",
    "     - Calculate the average or weighted average of the target values of the K neighbors and use it as the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied to Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Features:\n",
    "The Titanic dataset includes features such as **Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare**, and **Embarked**. These features are normalized before applying the KNN algorithm to ensure accurate distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Rules:\n",
    "- KNN identifies neighbors based on similarities in feature values. For example, passengers with similar **Pclass** and **Fare** might be closer neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome Examples:\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predict whether a passenger survived (binary classification: survived vs. not survived) by analyzing the survival outcomes of their closest neighbors.\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predict the fare a passenger might pay based on the fares of their closest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of KNN\n",
    "- Simple to understand and implement.\n",
    "- Flexible for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- No assumptions about data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of KNN\n",
    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "- Sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the value of 'K'.\n",
    "- Performance depends on well-normalized features and a representative training set."

    "### **Description of the Model**\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifier is a powerful machine learning technique that builds an **ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a stronger predictive model**. It is an iterative process where models are trained sequentially, and each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones. By combining the predictions of multiple models, Gradient Boosting **minimizes the overall prediction error and achieves high accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Gradient Boosting include:\n",
    "- **Sequential Learning**: Each model is trained to correct the residual errors of the prior models, ensuring continuous improvement.\n",
    "- **Additive Model**: Predictions are combined in a weighted manner to achieve better performance than any individual model.\n",
    "- **Loss Function Optimization**: The algorithm minimizes a user-specified loss function (e.g., log loss for classification or mean squared error for regression).\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that controls the contribution of each model to the final prediction, preventing overfitting.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Techniques like tree depth constraints, minimum samples per leaf, and shrinkage are used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gradient Boosting provides excellent performance, it may be computationally expensive and sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with a weak model (e.g., a simple decision tree) that predicts a constant value, such as the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Residual Computation**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the residuals (errors) between the true labels and the predictions made by the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train a Weak Model on Residuals**:\n",
    "   - Fit a new weak model (e.g., a decision tree) to the residuals. This weak model attempts to minimize the remaining error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Combine the predictions of the weak model with the predictions of the ensemble using a weighted learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - Iteratively add weak models to the ensemble until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of models or no significant improvement in performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Prediction**:\n",
    "   - Combine the predictions of all weak models in the ensemble to generate the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applied to Titanic Dataset**\n",
    "The **Titanic Dataset** includes features such as `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`, which are used to predict survival (`1` for survival, `0` for non-survival). Gradient Boosting Classifier can be applied to this dataset as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Process categorical features (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) and scale numerical features (e.g., `Age`, `Fare`) to ensure effective training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - Use Gradient Boosting to train a classifier on the Titanic dataset, minimizing a classification loss function (e.g., log loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - **Handles Mixed Data Types**: Efficiently handles both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "   - **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into the importance of features in predicting survival.\n",
    "   - **High Accuracy**: Performs well on imbalanced datasets with proper hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Considerations**:\n",
    "   - Carefully tune hyperparameters such as the number of estimators (trees), learning rate, and tree depth to prevent overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "   - Use techniques like cross-validation to validate model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifier is particularly well-suited for the Titanic dataset due to its ability to capture complex relationships and interactions between features, resulting in high predictive accuracy when properly tuned."

    "### Description of the Model\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin. By maximizing the margin, SVM enhances the generalization of the model, making it robust to unseen data. For non-linear data, SVM uses kernel functions to map data to higher dimensions, enabling effective classification in complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key assumptions include:**\n",
    "- **Separability of Classes**: Data can be linearly or non-linearly separable in the feature space.\n",
    "- **Margin Maximization**: The algorithm focuses on maximizing the margin between classes to improve decision boundary stability (Hyperplane).\n",
    "- **Use of Support Vectors**: Only the closest data points (support vectors) to the decision boundary affect its placement.\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: Kernels like linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) transform non-linear data into higher dimensions for separability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its advantages, SVM can be computationally intensive for very large datasets and sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters such as the kernel type, regularization parameter (C), and gamma (for RBF). Proper tuning and scaling of input features are essential for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Input Feature Space and Data Preparation**:  \n",
    "   - Input data is preprocessed and scaled to improve algorithm performance and avoid dominance of features with larger numerical ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperplane Optimization and finding the margin***:  \n",
    "   - SVM calculates the hyperplane* that maximizes the margin between two classes in a binary classification problem.\n",
    "   - **Margin Maximization** means increasing the distance (margin) between the hyperplane or **maximizing the distance between the hyperplane (decision boundary) and the closest data points from each class (support vectors)** and the closest data points from each class as much as possible. **The Best Hyperplane is the one that maximizes this margin**, making the model more flexible and better at handling new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Kernel Transformation (if needed)**:  \n",
    "   - For non-linearly separable data, a kernel function is applied to map input features to a higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regularization and Optimization**:  \n",
    "   - The regularization parameter (C) balances the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classification or Regression**:  \n",
    "   - After training, Support Vector* Machines predicts the class or value of new data points based on their position relative to the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applied to Titanic Dataset\n",
    "- The **Titanic dataset** includes features such as **Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked**.\n",
    "- SVM can be used to predict passenger survival (1) or non-survival (0) with high accuracy.\n",
    "- Features like **Sex (binary)** and numerical attributes such as **Age** and **Fare** can be normalized and used to train the SVM model effectively.\n",
    "- The kernel trick (e.g., RBF or polynomial kernels) can improve classification for non-linear relationships between features and outcomes.\n",
    "- SVM’s capability to handle both linear and non-linear data makes it suitable for complex datasets with overlapping or non-linear patterns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There were so many lessons from this project, but the biggest one for me is realizing that Sometimes what seems like the best approach, even when supported by data and logic, doesn’t work out as expected. You only truly learn what works once you launch, test, and adapt through trial and error and it’s all part of the process—**even when your assumptions seemed totally reasonable at first. It’s all about trial and error and figuring it out as you go.*"

    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "- Remove redundant or less relevant features, even if they seem meaningful or highly correlated. They might add unnecessary complexity without significantly improving model performance.\n",
    "- Figuring out which features are redundant depends heavily on individual judgment.\n",
    "- A good practice is to establish a baseline model without \"feature crosses\" first, then experiment by adding them one by one with the primary goal of improving the score.\n",
    "- Some features are better kept as continuous, such as `Fare`. Keeping it continuous:\n",
    "  - **Works Well Across Models**: Continuous values work well for algorithms like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting. Tree-based models like Random Forests can handle both continuous and categorical data without requiring manual binning\n",
    "  - **Saves Effort**: Avoids the additional step of defining and tuning bins, which can be arbitrary and might misalign with the dataset's structure.\n",
    "- Outlier management: Instead of binning, handle outliers through scaling or clipping (e.g., log transformation or capping high values).\n",
    "- Scaling requirements:\n",
    "  - **Crucial for**: Logistic Regression, KNN, SGD, Perceptron.\n",
    "  - **Not required for**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "  - **Optional for Linear Regression**: Helps in specific cases but is not mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "- What you think might work best isn’t always the case—trial and error, like with Random Forests, taught me valuable lessons about making and testing assumptions.\n",
    "- Some models, like Logistic Regression, prefer simplicity over granularity. For example:\n",
    "  - Binning `Age` into categories simplifies splits and reduces noise from outliers.\n",
    "  - Simplifying data, such as Binning Fare can simplify the data but risks losing valuable information. It should be tested carefully as it may affect model performance unpredictably. However, always start with a baseline model before introducing such changes.\n",
    "- Simplification can sometimes result in a loss of valuable information. Running experiments with and without simplified features can provide insights into their actual contribution to the model's performance.\n",
    "- Continuous features like `Fare` are generally preferred, especially for models that can directly handle them.\n",
    "- Ensure proper scaling for models that require it (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SGD, Perceptron). Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` before fitting these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Task Requirements\n",
    "- Understanding final requirements is essential. For example, instead of dropping null values in `Fare`, filling them appropriately ensures all rows are retained, as required for Kaggle submissions.\n"

    "This is an alternative approach I found from another Kaggle contributor. During model building, there are different ways to evaluate a model's performance, but I believe splitting the train and test data remains essential for a more realistic evaluation due to **overfitting** issues and Predicting only on the training dataset provides an inflated accuracy score and **fails to reflect the model's ability to generalize** to unseen data cause it remains untested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This methods will show how to use **Cross-Validation (suitable for Small Datasets)** becuase when the dataset is small, **splitting it into train and test sets may leave insufficient data** for training. In such cases, cross-validation is a better approach. Cross-validation provides a reliable measure of performance by testing the model on multiple folds of data, ensuring every data point is used for both training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Evaluate and Build the Model\n",
    "1. **Train and Predict on the Training Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Initially, train the model on the entire dataset and evaluate its accuracy on the same training data. While this accuracy will be high, it reflects only how well the model memorizes the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare Accuracy from Training Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Compare the model's accuracy when predicting on the training set among multiple models and select only the highest accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perform K-Fold Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "   - Use K-fold cross-validation to reflect the true accuracy of the model. This process splits the training data into multiple folds, testing the model’s ability to generalize across unseen subsets of the data. \n",
    "   - The mean accuracy score from cross-validation provides a more reliable metric for generalization and we will use this figures compared to the accuracy score from training dataset. The figurs will show **a significant drop in accuracy** due to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deploy to Test Dataset**:\n",
    "   - After selecting the best model based on cross-validation results, evaluate it on the reserved test dataset to simulate real-world performance and compute key performance indicators (KPIs).\n",

    "I have not executed the code in this notebook, but it is important to note that there are alternative approaches to model building for this case. Depending on the dataset, requirements, and computational resources."
